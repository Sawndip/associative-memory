oro-view is an OpenGL-based viewer for semantic networks.

The code is originally based on Gource, by Andrew Caudwell.

oro-view requires oro-server (http://oro.openrobots.org) to
fetch the concepts and their relationships.

The graph can be zoomed/panned with the mouse.

It features a special, shiny, "Active Concept" focus method:
if a concept is asserted to belong to the ActiveConcept class,
then it pops on the screen, as a bright, warm, yellow spot.
